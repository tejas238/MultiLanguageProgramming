//Main.java file for Problem 2 by Tejas Menon, CS320, last edited 10/9. This file contains an instance of problem 2
//that automatically generates all expression instances of the type 10x10y10z10a where x,y,z and a represent operands and
//different parenthesis configurations for each instance to create a total of 320 unique expressions of 'interest'.
