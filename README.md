# MultiLanguageProgramming
Equivalent programs written in Java, Prolog and Haskell to explore similarities and differences between Imperative, Logical and Functional language paradigms respectively.

## Expression Generation in Haskell
All possible decimal expressions using four 10s with a result 0<x<10 are output using a build, split, merge strategy.

## Expression Generation in Prolog
Equivalent program to create decimal expressions using the logic programming paradigm. 

## Expression Generation in Java
Equivalent program to create decimal expressions using OOP paradigm

## Int To Full Form Conversion
Java Program to convert an integer to its textual equivalent i.e. 1,235,110 converts to One Million Two Hundred Thirty Five Thousand One Hundred Ten
